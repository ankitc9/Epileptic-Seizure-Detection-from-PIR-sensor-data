# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection-from-PIR-sensor-data
## About
This project is based on study by Ouday Hanush, Rashid Ansari , Fellow, IEEE, Khaled Younis, and A. Enis Cetin, Fellow, IEEE. More about their paper- Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection During Sleep Using Passive Infrared Sensors can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8674798)

The Data provided by Professor Cetin towards final project for coursework ECE/BIO 407 Pattern Recognition II at University of Illinois at Chicago, is a real time PIR sensor data obtained from their study on 33 subjects during sleep.
